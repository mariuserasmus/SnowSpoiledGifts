I would like to start the planning for a new Online order website: www.snowspoiledgifts.co.za

Description:
This will be for our home business that consists of a variety of items\areas\products. These are, but not limited to... 3D Printing, Sublimation, Vinyl, Giftboxes, etc.

Look and Feel:
The website style should be fun\funky...but still profesional looking. 
Keep in mind that most people use their mobile phones these days for browsing and online shopping. So this means collapsing Menus, etc. There will be a lot of images... but keep them small\thumbnails so that the pages load quick\fast... but with the option to click on any image for a larger view.

Site layout:
I'm imagining a menu bar...either on the side or the top...with all he Menu options. Somewhere a nice Logo (will be supplied)
Then a flashy area where ...if configured...will show current Specials. Could even be an area where the Latest\Most popular items are pinned for a while.
Then an area where the MAIN product areas are displayed as cards....possible with a random photo from that Product Area...allowing users to click\hover ...and then presented with the Sub\sub-sub Areas inside that main area. When they click there...it will take them to that specific page dedicated to that area\sub\sub-sub area.
For instance: Say there are these Main areas...
3D Printing, Sublimation, Vinyl, Giftboxes
The user is interested in 3D printing (Cookie Cutters)...so he hovers over 3D Printing....which should then show the Sub areas: Cookie Cutters, Cake Toppers, Toys, Tools, Custom Designs
When he clicks on Cookie Cutters...it should take him to that Cookie Cutters Page. Since Cookie cutters are SO varried (as with the other product areas as well)....there will need to be various filters to allow for easy filtering (to be defined...based on the available data fields). This will prevent more pages to navigate to...creating a very complicated and confusing website.
Also an "About Us" area...with a nice little story that describes the business\vision\etc. (will be supplied)
And then all an area for various Social Media links.
And "Contact Us" area and also a "FAQ" section

Functionality:
Users should be able to browse the website for products, in an of the areas, sub-areas... be able to add items to their cart, view cart, checkout, etc.
For now, payment will be handled as EFT or COD. Only at a later stage can a paygate be integrated.
Users should be able to select Pick Up ...or Delivery. Delivery will be handled by PUDO\Courier Guy...and for now a standard flatrate delivery fee will be R100. Other price options can be added later.

Site access:
Anybody should be able to browse\add items to cart...but only Logged in users will be able to check out and confirm orders. If possible...automatically detect\log in existing users. Allow new users to Create an account.
Collect all the popular\general user information... but Name, Surname, Email (used for username), Cellphone number, Address (only if ticked for delivery) will be compulsory.

Users:
Logged in users should be able to manage their accounts\passwords\delete account\etc...check Order status...Query order status...etc.

Admin:
There should be an Admin area that is only accessible for Admins.
This should include full Order view\maintain, User maintenance, Reporting area for tracking Sales, etc.
There should also be an area where Products can be updated, new photos uploaded, Specials setup, etc.
If possible...able to update\add\change "FAQ" options.

Products:
As mentioned...the website will sell, but not limited to these MAIN areas...3D Printing, Sublimation, Vinyl, Giftboxes, etc
Each MAIN area should be handled\stored seperately in the backend ....as each MAIN\Sub\sub-sub area has very unique requirements. This will be a hugely Phased approach to get each area implemented. Each MAIN area can\could also consist of various sub and sub-sub areas....and as \when we implement this...they might also need to be saved\handled seperately. Each Main\Sub\sub-sub will have very specific product qualities... like Size, Length, Width, Height, Color, etc, etc.
Each Product will also need to cater for multiple photos....of which 1 can be selected as the Default profile photo (or default to the 1st uploaded photo).

Product Requests\Quote:
For each MAIN product area...there should also be the option to Request a new Item. For instance.... for 3D printing.... someone might be browsing the Cookie Cutter section...but they can't find what they are looking for (since we do not have that specific cutter yet)...so the user should be able to Request a new Cookie Cutter...supply all the Dimensions\Descriptions\etc....with the option to upload an image...and submit that request to us. Even better if the request\quote can be linked to an existing item...like a "similar to this product". Using this "related to" option, will also help that the Quote request asks all the right questions....for instance Size, Color, Height, width, etc.... Or worst case....they can just fill in a General Request\Quote form....and they just need to type everything in a Description box (if no related item was selected).

Technology stack:
Python
Website framework... use something like Flask... or if you can suggest something that is better for an online shop. Nothing too complicated. This is NOT a Online Order system that needs to be monitored 24/7, like a take-away\food shop.
