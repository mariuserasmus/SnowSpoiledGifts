## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Admin Authorization Flow
1. User logs in → `is_admin` attribute loaded from database
2. Flask-Login's `current_user.is_admin` available in all templates
3. Navbar conditionally renders based on admin status
4. Admin routes protected with `@admin_required` decorator

### Order Management Flow
1. Admin views orders dashboard (all orders or filtered by status)
2. Admin clicks "View" to see order details
3. Admin updates status and optionally sends email notification
4. Database updated → Email sent → Admin redirected with success message

### Email Notification Flow
1. Admin submits status update form
2. `admin_update_order_status()` route called
3. Database status updated via `db.update_order_status()`
4. If email checkbox checked:
   - User info fetched from database
   - `send_order_status_update()` called with config, email, order#, status, name
   - Email sent with status-specific template
5. Flash message confirms success
