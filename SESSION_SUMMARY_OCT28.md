# Session Summary - October 28, 2025

## 🎉 What We Accomplished Today

### 1. ✅ Fixed Production Email Issue
**Problem:** `[Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address` on Afrihost production server

**Root Cause:** Afrihost blocks Gmail SMTP (ports 587/465)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `MAIL_USE_SSL` configuration support for port 465
- Updated all 5 email functions in `src/email_utils.py` to support SSL connections
- Changed `NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS` to parse from `.env` file (comma-separated)
- Updated configuration templates with Afrihost SMTP settings

**Files Modified:**
- `src/config.py` - Added MAIL_USE_SSL + dynamic NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS
- `src/email_utils.py` - All email functions now support SMTP_SSL
- `deployment/PRODUCTION_ENV_TEMPLATE.md` - Afrihost SMTP configuration

**Files Created:**
- `deployment/FIX_PRODUCTION_EMAIL.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Upload `src/config.py` and `src/email_utils.py` to production
2. Edit production `.env` file with Afrihost SMTP settings
3. Restart application
4. Test email by submitting a quote request

**Production `.env` Settings:**
```env
MAIL_SERVER=mail.snowspoiledgifts.co.za
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USE_SSL=True
MAIL_USE_TLS=False
MAIL_USERNAME=info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za
MAIL_PASSWORD=<your_info_email_password>
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za
NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=elmienerasmus@gmail.com,mariuserasmus69@gmail.com
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with Afrihost (no more errors)
- ✅ Emails from professional domain (info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za)
- ✅ Multiple CC recipients (both Elmien and Marius)
- ✅ Backward compatible with TLS for local development

### 2. ✅ Documentation Reorganization
**Problem:** 14+ markdown files scattered in root directory, hard to find documentation

**Solution:** Complete documentation cleanup with logical folder structure

**Folder Structure Created:**

- Technical docs: [`docs/`](docs/)

---

## 🚀 Next Session Tasks

1. **Deploy Email Fix** (High Priority)
   - Upload `src/config.py` and `src/email_utils.py`
   - Update production `.env` with Afrihost SMTP

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical
- **SMTP_SSL vs SMTP:** Port 465 requires `smtplib.SMTP_SSL`, not `SMTP` with `starttls()`
- **Shared Hosting:** Many hosts block external SMTP for security
- **Configuration:** Use host's email server for better compatibility
- **Git File Moves:** Git automatically detects file renames/moves

### Documentation
- **Master Index:** Single entry point makes navigation easy
- **Folder Structure:** Group by purpose (deployment, technical, historical)
- **README per Folder:** Explain what's in each folder
- **Archive Strategy:** Keep old docs for reference, don't delete

### 5. ✅ cPanel Git Deployment Configuration
**Problem:** Manual deployment clicking was tedious

**Journey:**
1. **Attempted Auto-Deploy** - Set up git push to cPanel for automatic deployment
2. **Hit Permission Issues** - `setuid root` errors with various commands
3. **Tried Multiple Fixes** - Simplified .cpanel.yml multiple times
4. **Final Decision** - Reverted to manual deployment (more reliable)

**What We Learned:**
- cPanel auto-deploy has permission restrictions on shared hosting
- Manual deployment via cPanel Git interface works reliably
- Repository path: `/home/snowsxtp/repositories/ssg`
- Application path: `/home/snowsxtp/ssg`

**Final Working Configuration:**
```yaml
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export REPOPATH=/home/snowsxtp/repositories/ssg
    - export APPPATH=/home/snowsxtp/ssg
    - /bin/cp -R $REPOPATH/* $APPPATH/
    - /bin/touch $APPPATH/tmp/restart.txt
```

**Manual Deployment Workflow:**
1. `git push origin main` (push to GitHub)
2. cPanel → Git Version Control
3. Click "Update From Remote"
4. Click "Deploy HEAD Commit"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

**Files Modified:**
- `.cpanel.yml` - Deployment configuration
- `version_check.py` - Created for deployment verification
- `app.py` - Added `/version-check` route
