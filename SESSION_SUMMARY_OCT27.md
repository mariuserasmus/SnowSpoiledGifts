## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Wins
- **Data Attributes** - Best practice for passing data from HTML → JavaScript
- **Photo Path Handling** - Windows path separators need conversion for URLs
- **Nested Forms** - Never nest forms in HTML (breaks submission)
- **JSON Escaping** - Use `|tojson` but avoid double-escaping with `|e`

### Best Practices Applied
- Use data attributes instead of inline JavaScript strings
- Calculate dates in backend, not frontend
- Proper error handling with try/except
- Console logging for debugging
- Mobile-first responsive design
