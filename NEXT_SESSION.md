## 💭 Next Topic: Payment & Banking Details

### Your Thoughts to Consider:
> "Then we need to think about the process to send someone my ETL Banking details. Let me think about it till then."

### Discussion Points for Next Session:

**Questions to Think About:**

1. **When should banking details be sent?**
   - After order is placed (in order confirmation email)?
   - Only for specific payment methods?
   - When order status changes to "Awaiting Payment"?

2. **What payment methods do you want to support?**
   - ✅ Cash on Delivery (already exists)
   - 🏦 EFT/Bank Transfer (manual - send banking details)
   - 💳 Instant EFT (PayFast integration)
   - 💳 Credit/Debit Card (PayFast/Stripe/PayPal)
   - 📱 Mobile Payment (SnapScan, Zapper, etc.)

3. **EFT Banking Details Format:**
   - What information needs to be included?
   - Bank name, account holder, account number, branch code, reference?
   - Should it be in email template or separate PDF?

4. **Payment Verification:**
   - How do you verify EFT payments?
   - Manual check vs automated reconciliation?
   - How to update order status after payment received?

5. **Order Flow with EFT:**
   ```
   Customer places order
   ↓
   Order created with status "Awaiting Payment"
   ↓
   Email sent with banking details & reference number
   ↓
   Customer makes EFT payment
   ↓
   ??? How do you know payment was made? ???
   ↓
   Update order status to "Paid"
   ↓
   Process order
   ```

## 🎨 Potential Solutions to Discuss:

### **Option A: Simple Manual EFT**
- Add banking details to order confirmation email

### **Option B: PayFast Integration** (Recommended)
- Integrate PayFast (South African payment gateway)
- Supports: Instant EFT, Credit Cards, Debit Cards
- Automatic payment confirmation
- **Pros:** Professional, automated, instant confirmation
- **Cons:** Requires setup, transaction fees (~3.9%)

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep manual EFT option with banking details
- Add PayFast for customers who want instant payment
- Give customers choice during checkout
- **Pros:** Flexibility, caters to all customers
- **Cons:** More complex implementation

### **Option D: Admin-Triggered Banking Email**
- Admin manually sends banking details email when ready
