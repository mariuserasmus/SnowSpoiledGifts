#### Technical Implementation

**Order Number Generation Fix:**
```python
# Old (caused duplicates):
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_number LIKE ?')

# New (prevents duplicates):
cursor.execute('''
    SELECT order_number FROM orders
    WHERE order_number LIKE ?
    ORDER BY order_number DESC
    LIMIT 1
''')
last_sequence = int(last_order['order_number'].split('-')[-1])
order_sequence = last_sequence + 1
```

**Invoice Auto-Generation:**
```python
if new_status in ['confirmed', 'awaiting_payment'] and not order.get('invoice_number'):
    success, invoice_number = db.generate_invoice_number(order_number)
    pdf_success, pdf_result = generate_invoice_pdf(order, customer, order_items, app.config)
```

**Logo Embedding in Emails:**
```python
def get_logo_embedded():
    logo_path = os.path.join('static', 'images', 'logo', 'SSG-Logo.png')
    with open(logo_path, 'rb') as f:
        logo_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()
        return f'data:image/png;base64,{logo_data}'
```
