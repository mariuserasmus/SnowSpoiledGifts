   - Defaults to: `elmienerasmus@gmail.com,mariuserasmus69@gmail.com`

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Changed from Gmail SMTP to Afrihost SMTP
   - Mail server: `mail.snowspoiledgifts.co.za`
   - Port: 465 (SSL)
   - Sender: `info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za`

#### Files Modified
- `src/config.py` - Added MAIL_USE_SSL + dynamic NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS
- `src/email_utils.py` - Updated all email functions (5 total) to support SMTP_SSL
- `PRODUCTION_ENV_TEMPLATE.md` - Updated with Afrihost SMTP settings

#### Files Created
- `FIX_PRODUCTION_EMAIL.md` - Step-by-step guide to fix production email

### Technical Implementation

**Old Code (Gmail - Not Working on Afrihost):**
```python
with smtplib.SMTP(config['MAIL_SERVER'], config['MAIL_PORT']) as server:
    server.starttls()  # TLS on port 587
    server.login(...)
```

**New Code (Afrihost - Working):**
```python
if config.get('MAIL_USE_SSL'):
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(config['MAIL_SERVER'], config['MAIL_PORT']) as server:
        server.login(...)  # SSL on port 465
else:
    with smtplib.SMTP(...) as server:

```

**After:**
```env
MAIL_SERVER=mail.snowspoiledgifts.co.za
MAIL_PORT=465

## Session Summary (2025-10-28 - Documentation Reorganization)

### 📚 COMPLETED: Documentation Cleanup & Organization

**Issue:** Too many markdown files scattered in root directory, hard to find documentation

**Solution:** Complete documentation reorganization with folder structure

#### What Was Organized

1. **Created Folder Structure**
   - `deployment/` - All deployment and production guides
   - `archive/` - Historical/superseded documentation
   - `docs/` - Technical system documentation (already existed)

2. **Moved Files to Appropriate Folders**

   **To `deployment/`:**
   - `FIX_PRODUCTION_EMAIL.md` - Email troubleshooting guide
   - `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` - Quick deployment reference
   - `AFRIHOST_PASSENGER_SETUP.md` - Main deployment guide
   - `PRODUCTION_ENV_TEMPLATE.md` - Environment configuration

   **To `archive/`:**
   - `SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT27.md` - Historical session summary
   - `README_RESUME.md` - Old quick start guide
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_GIT.md` - Old deployment guide
   - `CPANEL_GIT_SETUP.md` - Git deployment (deprecated)
   - `GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - GitHub setup
   - `PASSENGER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Old troubleshooting
   - `WHERE_IS_CONFIG.md` - Config FAQ

   **To `docs/`:**
   - `CHECKPOINT_COOKIE_CUTTERS_ADMIN.md` - Admin system docs

3. **Created Master Documentation Files**
   - `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Master navigation guide for all docs
   - `deployment/README.md` - Deployment folder index
   - `archive/README.md` - Archive folder index with explanations

4. **Updated Main Documentation**
   - `README.md` - Updated with new folder structure and links
   - Project overview reflects current features
   - Added documentation navigation section
