#### Technical Implementation

**Order Number Generation Fix:**
```python
# Old (caused duplicates):
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_number LIKE ?')

# New (prevents duplicates):
cursor.execute('''
    SELECT order_number FROM orders
    WHERE order_number LIKE ?
    ORDER BY order_number DESC
    LIMIT 1
''')
last_sequence = int(last_order['order_number'].split('-')[-1])
order_sequence = last_sequence + 1
```

**Invoice Auto-Generation:**
```python
if new_status in ['confirmed', 'awaiting_payment'] and not order.get('invoice_number'):
    success, invoice_number = db.generate_invoice_number(order_number)
    pdf_success, pdf_result = generate_invoice_pdf(order, customer, order_items, app.config)
```

**Logo Embedding in Emails:**
```python
def get_logo_embedded():
    logo_path = os.path.join('static', 'images', 'logo', 'SSG-Logo.png')
    with open(logo_path, 'rb') as f:
        logo_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()
        return f'data:image/png;base64,{logo_data}'
```

## Session Summary (2025-10-31 - Quote System: View Uploaded Images & Fix Email Recipients)

### üêõ BUG FIXES: Quote Request Image Viewing & Email Configuration

**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ

#### Issues Resolved

1. **Quote Request Images Not Viewable**
   - **Problem:** Uploaded reference images were saved to disk but admin panel only showed filenames with no way to view/download them
   - **Location:** `static/uploads/quote_references/`, `static/uploads/cake_topper_references/`
   - **Solution:** Added clickable download/view buttons for each uploaded file in admin quotes detail modal
   - **Files Modified:** `templates/admin-quotes.html` (lines 262-276 for Custom Design, lines 312-326 for Cake Topper)

2. **Missing Email Recipient for Quote Notifications**
   - **Problem:** Quote request emails were only being sent to `mariuserasmus69@gmail.com` and `elmienerasmus@gmail.com`
   - **Missing:** `info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za` was not receiving quote notifications
   - **Solution:** Added `NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS` to `.env` file with all three email addresses
   - **Configuration:** `.env` line 27: `NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za,elmienerasmus@gmail.com,mariuserasmus69@gmail.com`

#### Technical Implementation

**Image Viewing in Admin Panel:**
```html
{% if quote.reference_images %}
<div class="mb-3">
    <h6><i class="fas fa-image"></i> Reference Images</h6>
    <p><span class="badge bg-info">{{ quote.reference_images.split(',') | length }} file(s) uploaded</span></p>
    <div class="uploaded-files-list">
        {% for filename in quote.reference_images.split(',') %}
        <div class="mb-2">
            <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='uploads/quote_references/' + filename) }}" target="_blank" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary">
                <i class="fas fa-download"></i> {{ filename }}
            </a>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

**Email Configuration:**
- Email notification system uses `config['NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS']` from `src/email_utils.py`
- All quote types (Custom Design, Cake Topper, Print Service) now send to all three addresses
- Primary recipient shown in "To:" field, additional recipients in "Cc:" field

#### Files Modified
- `templates/admin-quotes.html` - Added download buttons for uploaded images (2 sections)
- `.env` - Added NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS with all three email addresses
- `src/config.py` - Already configured to read from .env (lines 52-55)

#### How It Works Now
1. **Viewing Images:** Admin can click on any filename in the quote detail modal to view/download the image in a new tab
2. **Email Distribution:** All new quote requests automatically send notification emails to:
   - info@snowspoiledgifts.co.za (Primary business email)
   - elmienerasmus@gmail.com (Primary admin)
   - mariuserasmus69@gmail.com (Secondary admin)
